It is said that thou mayst gain entry to Moloch's sanctuary, if thou
darest, from a place where the ground vibrateth in the deepest depths of
Gehennom.  Thou needs must have the aid of three magical items.  The
pure sound of a silver bell shall announce thee.  The terrible runes,
read from Moloch's book, shall cause the earth to tremble mightily.  The
light of an enchanted candelabrum shall show thee the way.

And where it is written "ad aerarium", diligent searching will often reveal
the way to a trap which sends one to the Magic Memory Vault, where the riches
of Croesus are stored; however, escaping from the vault with its gold is much
harder than getting in
